## Functions

```jsx
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n")
}
```

- Notice also the special symbol \n in your code. Try removing those characters and making your program again by executing make hello. Typing ./hello in the terminal window, how did your program change? This \ character is called an escape character that tells the compiler that \n is a special instruction.
  note: #include <stdio.h> this call header file

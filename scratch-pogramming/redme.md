## What is binary?

Binary describes a numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit -- 0 or 1 -- and is the basis for all binary code used in computing systems. These systems use this code to understand operational instructions and user input and to present a relevant output to the user.

## Binary explained

The binary numbering system was refined in the 17th century by Gottfried Leibniz. In mathematics and in computing systems, a binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data. Each bit has a single value of either 1 or 0, which means it can't take on any other value.

Computers can represent numbers using binary code in the form of digital 1s and 0s inside the central processing unit (CPU) and RAM. These digital numbers are electrical signals that are either on or off inside the CPU or RAM.

## Number system base

- Dosomic => base 10 (0, 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7, 8 ,9)
- Binary => base 2 (0 , 1)
- octal => base 8 (0 , 1 , 2 , 3, 4 , 5 , 6 , 7)
- Decimal => base 10 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- hexadecimal => base 16 (0-9, A,B,C,D,E,F)

## decimal number to binary

To convert a decimal number to binary, you can use the following steps:

- Divide the decimal number by 2.

- Write down the remainder, which is either 0 or 1.

- Repeat steps 1 and 2 with the quotient from the previous division until the quotient is 0.

- Read the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation.

## octal to hexadecimal

To convert an octal number to hexadecimal, you can:

- Convert the octal number to binary

- Group the binary bits into sets of four

- Calculate the value of each set from left to right

For example, to convert 536 from octal to hexadecimal, you can:

- Convert 536 to binary: (536){8} = (101) (011) (110) = (101011110){2}
- Group the binary bits into sets of four: (101011110)2=(0001)(0101)(1110)
- Calculate the value of each set from left to right: (15E)16

The hexadecimal value for 536 is 15E.

## What is unary

A unary operation is a mathematical operator that has only one operand, or input. This is in contrast to binary operations, which use two operands. Examples of unary operations include negation, incrementing, decrementing, and complementing.

## what is bit and byte

A bit is the smallest unit of digital information, while a byte is a larger unit of digital information made up of eight bits.

### Bits

A bit is represented as either 0 or 1, and is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communication. Computers process information and send and receive data as bits.

### Bytes

A byte can represent a number, a letter, a symbol, or a small amount of data. The standard number of bits in a byte is eight, but this can vary depending on the hardware and system.
=> 8 byte one group collection

## what is unicode

Unicode is a standard that assigns a unique numeric value to every character, regardless of the language, platform, or program. It is a universal character set that includes characters from almost all of the world's living languages, as well as mathematical symbols and emojis
